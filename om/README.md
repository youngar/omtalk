# Om

a default object model for the omtalk gc.

This builds on the core gc with a library of objects, and provides the complete set of GC glue code. If you don't have
an object model for your language already, you should start with this.

MLIR integration for om is provided by om-mlir.

A structure definition utility is located in tools/om-gen. om-gen uses MLIR integration in order to work.
